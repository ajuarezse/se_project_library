# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is my first project in the Software Engineer program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief. The goal of the landing page is to welcome visitors and provide essential information about the library. It highlights the library's importance to the community, encourages membership sign-ups, and showcases a selection of books from the "Staff Picks" section.
