# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is my first project in the Software Engineer program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief. The goal of the landing page is to welcome visitors and provide essential information about the library. It highlights the library's importance to the community, encourages membership sign-ups, and showcases a selection of books from the "Staff Picks" section.

## Project features

Responsive Layout 📱: The landing page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Hero Section 🎯: A welcoming introduction to the library, including an eye-catching headline and brief description to engage visitors.
Navigation Bar 🧭: A simple and clean navigation bar that helps users quickly find information about the library.
Staff Picks Section 📚: A highlight of recommended books, focusing on selections that appeal to those interested in computer programming.
